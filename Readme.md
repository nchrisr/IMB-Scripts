**IMB-Scripts**

A repository used for storing scripts that were used to process IMB data.

-> The scripts in the **Duplicate_Checks** directory were used to identify file duplicates across two separate folders.

-> The scripts in the directory **File_Processing** are the scripts used in the actual cleaning of the data. 
Further documentation for each of the scripts can be found in the docs directory and as in-line comments within the code.
Note that each file in the docs directory is named after its respective script in the **File_Processing** directory. As 
an example if a script is called **File_Organizer.py**, the file containing its documentation in the docs folder will be
called **File_Organizer.md**.
