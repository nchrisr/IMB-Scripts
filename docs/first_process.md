# **first_process.py**

- **DIRECTORY_TREES** is a dictionary which is used to represent the directory structure used for storing the files

  > As an example if the dictionary has a key value pair `"01": [2009, 2010]` a directory structure will be created 
  like in the diagram below:
  
  >      |------01
  >              |-------2009
  >              |-------2010
